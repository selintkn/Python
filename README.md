# Python
This project uses Python’s Turtle graphics library to draw a simple bar chart from a list of numerical values.
Bars are drawn upward or downward depending on whether the value is positive or negative, and are color-coded according to predefined thresholds.
The project demonstrates conditional logic, functions, and basic data visualization.
